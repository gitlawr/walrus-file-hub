## Nextcloud with MySQL

Nextcloud is a suite of client-server software for creating and using file hosting services. Nextcloud application functionally is similar to Dropbox. Unlike Dropbox, Nextcloud does not offer off-premises file storage hosting. Nextcloud is free and open-source, which means that anyone is allowed to install and operate it on their own private server devices.

This example defines one of the basic setups for Nextcloud. It deploys Nextcloud alongside a MySQL database using containers. For more details on the Nextcloud image, see its [documentation](https://hub.docker.com/_/nextcloud/).
