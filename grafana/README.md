## Grafana

Grafana is an open source, feature rich metrics dashboard and graph editor for Graphite, Elasticsearch, OpenTSDB, Prometheus and InfluxDB. It is most commonly used for visualizing time series data for infrastructure and application analytics but many use it in other domains including industrial sensors, home automation, weather, and process control. 

This example defines a basic setup for Grafana. For additional information on configuring and managing Grafana, refer to its [documentation](http://docs.grafana.org/).
